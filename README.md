P3tsKit
Pet owners often face challenges in identifying external health issues in their pets, leading to delayed treatment. Our app addresses this by using machine learning to analyze smartphone or uploaded images, quickly detecting external diseases in dogs and cats. This tool empowers pet owners to respond to their pets' health needs promptly and effectively.
